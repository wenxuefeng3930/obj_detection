This repository is an attempt to use object detection and tracking in a real world use case.

This post shall discuss on a use case where we attempt to use object detection and tracking algorithm to check for obstruction within a specified zone in a video feed using OpenCV-Python. The concept described is similar to that of an abandoned-object detection where we detect object and track object to determine static object and flagging it out for a prolonged period of time
